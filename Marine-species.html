    <h2>Types of marine life</h2>
    <div><img src="./imgs/fish.jpg" alt="Fishes"><br>
        <h4>Fishes</h4>
        <p><b>Summary: </b>Aquatic vertebrates that breathe through gills and move using fins. They come in a wide
            variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, and are a vital part of aquatic food chains.</p>
    </div>
    <div><img src="./imgs/Whales.jpg" alt="Whales"><br>
        <h4>Whales</h4>
        <p><b>Summary: </b>Large marine mammals that breathe air through lungs and give birth to live young. They are
            highly intelligent and communicate using complex sounds. They live in oceans around the world.</p>
    </div>
    <div><img src="./imgs/Shark.jpeg" alt="Shark"><br>
        <h4>Shark</h4>
        <p><b>Summary: </b>Powerful predatory fish with cartilage-based skeletons instead of bones. Known for their
            sharp senses, especially smell, and play a key role in maintaining the balance of marine ecosystems.</p>
    </div>
    <div><img src="./imgs/Coral-Reefs.jpg" alt="Coral Reefs"><br>
        <h4>Coral Reefs</h4>
        <p><b>Summary: </b>Natural structures formed by tiny living organisms called corals. Found in warm, shallow
            waters, they provide habitat for countless marine species and help protect coastlines from erosion.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div><img src="./imgs/Dolphins.jpg" alt="Dolphins"><br>
        <h4>Dolphins</h4>
        <p><b>Summary: </b>Intelligent and social marine mammals that live in pods. They breathe air, use echolocation
            to navigate and hunt, and are known for their playful behavior and friendliness toward humans.</p>
